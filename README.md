🧩 Admin Dashboard with CSS Grid Layout and Theme Switching
📌 Title
Admin Dashboard with CSS Grid Layout and Theme Switching

🎯 Objective
Build a professional, responsive admin dashboard UI using:

HTML

CSS Grid Layout

A working Light/Dark Theme Toggle (without reloading the page)

The goal is to practice advanced layout design and implement theme adaptability using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

📋 Task Description
This project includes the following sections:

🧱 Header: Contains the title (Admin Dashboard) and a Dark Mode toggle switch

🧭 Sidebar: Navigation links like Home, Users, and Settings

📊 Main Content Area: Placeholder for content (charts, data, or welcome message)

📝 Footer: Shows footer text (like copyright)

🎨 Features
Uses CSS Grid for clean, responsive layout.

Fully responsive UI: Adjusts smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Theme Switching Functionality:

Light & Dark mode toggle using a checkbox.

Changes entire layout colors dynamically (no page reload needed).

Controlled via JavaScript and CSS class toggling.

💻 Technologies Used
HTML5

CSS3 (with CSS Grid)

Vanilla JavaScript (for theme toggle logic)

⚙️ How It Works
A checkbox in the header enables dark mode

JavaScript listens for checkbox changes

When toggled, a dark-mode class is added/removed from the <body>

CSS updates background, text, and UI element colors accordingly

📷 Expected Output
Clean layout with 4 main parts:

Header at top

Sidebar on left

Main content on right

Footer at bottom

Responsive grid layout

Smooth toggle between light and dark themes
